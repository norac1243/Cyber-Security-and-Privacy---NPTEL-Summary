| What are some of the key topics covered in the Cybersecurity and Privacy course?                    | The course covers technologies for access control, identification, authentication, and authorization, as well as encryption technologies essential for cybersecurity, including their roles in e-commerce and trust in financial transactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Why is encryption important in cybersecurity?                                                        | Encryption is critical because it protects data during transmission, ensuring that even if unauthorized access occurs, the data remains unintelligible. It is foundational for secure e-commerce transactions, as it enables the safe transmission of sensitive information like credit card details over public networks.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| What is blockchain technology and its security features?                                            | Blockchain is a linked list of blocks that ensures confidentiality, non-repudiation, and integrity through encryption. Each transaction is linked to a private key, preventing denial of transactions and ensuring that once a transaction is recorded, it cannot be altered (immutability) due to the hash function associated with each block.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| What is the significance of hash functions in blockchain?                                            | Hash functions create a unique, immutable value for each block. If any data in the block is altered, the hash value changes, indicating tampering. This feature maintains the integrity of the blockchain, ensuring that transactions cannot be modified retroactively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| What are some encryption standards discussed in the course?                                          | The course discusses the Data Encryption Standard (DES), Triple DES, and the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), along with RSA. DES was considered insecure due to vulnerabilities, leading to the development of more robust standards like Triple DES and AES, which support key lengths of 128, 192, or 256 bits.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| How difficult is it to break encrypted messages?                                                      | Breaking encrypted messages is virtually impossible with current standards. For instance, decrypting a 128-bit key could take an impractically long time, making it highly secure against unauthorized access. No significant incidents of successfully decrypting standard encryption have been widely reported, emphasizing the reliability of encryption technologies.                                                                                                                                             |
| What is the focus of the next part of the course regarding Privacy?                                   | The focus will shift to Information Privacy, exploring its differences from general privacy, its connection to cybersecurity, and the implications of privacy for individuals and organizations. The course will also include a case discussion on these topics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| What example is provided regarding encrypted messages in popular media?                                | A recent example involves a WhatsApp conversation displayed on television between two celebrities. Despite claims of end-to-end encryption, the public airing of the private conversation raises questions about privacy and the potential for unauthorized access, even though breaking the encryption itself is highly unlikely. This case illustrates the complexities surrounding privacy in the context of technology and media.                                                                                                            |
