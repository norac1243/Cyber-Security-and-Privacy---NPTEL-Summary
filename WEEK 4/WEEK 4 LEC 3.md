| Why is it crucial for companies to have an internal IT team?                                                                                                                                         | An internal IT team ensures that incidents can be managed effectively without relying on external third-party services, as seen in the example where users could not access servers during an attack. This prevents confusion and ensures that roles and responsibilities are clearly defined during incidents.                                                                                                                                         |
| What did the NIST recommend for managing cyber attacks?                                                                                                                                              | NIST suggested forming a contingency management committee (CPMT) with defined roles, including identifying the source of attacks and maintaining forensic reports. They emphasized the need for clear communication and a parallel server to keep business operations running during an attack.                                                                                                                                           |
