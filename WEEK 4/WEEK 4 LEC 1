| What is the focus of the Cybersecurity and Privacy course? | The course builds foundations for cybersecurity management by understanding fundamental concepts and examining cases to connect principles with practice. |
| What are the two aspects of planning discussed in the course? | Preventive planning (risk management) and reactive planning (contingency planning). |
| What does contingency planning entail? | Contingency planning is about preparing for incidents that may occur and outlining actions to take when things go wrong. |
| Why is it important for a company to have a contingency plan? | A contingency plan provides clarity on actions to take during incidents, preventing chaos and ensuring quick recovery. |
| What example was discussed regarding poor contingency planning? | The iPremier company was ill-prepared for a significant incident, leading to confusion and lack of direction during the crisis. |
| How does contingency planning relate to the concept of a fire drill? | Just like fire drills prepare staff for emergencies, contingency planning prepares an organization to follow established protocols during incidents. |
| What happens emotionally when there is no contingency plan? | People may react emotionally, calling for help or panicking, instead of following a clear plan. |
| What was the situation with IVK's IT department regarding cybersecurity investment? | The IT director proposed investing in an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), but the proposal was dropped due to lack of perceived return on investment. |
| Why do finance departments often reject cybersecurity investments? | They seek quantifiable returns on investment, which can be challenging to demonstrate for security systems. |
| How can the cost of not investing in cybersecurity be estimated? | By estimating potential incidents, recovery costs, and lost revenue due to downtime. |
| What is the challenge of assessing cybersecurity risk? | Accurate risk assessment is difficult due to the dynamic nature of cyber threats and the lack of cyber insurance options. |
| What is a key takeaway regarding the perception of cybersecurity by management? | Management must understand that cybersecurity investments are not about generating new revenue but about preventing potential losses. |
| What did the cases of iPremier and IVK illustrate about cybersecurity priorities? | Both cases showed that cybersecurity was a low priority, leading to significant risks and failures in managing cyber threats. |
| What happens if organizations do not invest in cybersecurity?                                               | Organizations may face increased risks and potential incidents, as technical staff are aware of the vulnerabilities and will be disappointed if proper measures are not in place.                                             |
