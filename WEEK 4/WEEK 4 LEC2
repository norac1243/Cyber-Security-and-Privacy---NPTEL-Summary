It quantifies impacts in currency units to facilitate decision-making.                                                                                                           |
| What is the Business Impact Analysis (BIA) in contingency planning?                                       | The BIA is a critical assessment initiated by the contingency planning committee (CPMT) to evaluate the severity of various attacks and their potential business impact on different processes. It focuses on analyzing the impact of incidents on business processes rather than just assets.                                                                                 |
| What are the four standard time-related parameters in the BIA process?                                    | The four parameters are: Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD), Recovery Time Objective (RTO), Work Recovery Time (WRT), and Recovery Point Objective (RPO).                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Each business process must be analyzed individually to establish these timelines.                                                                                                                   |
| Why is downtime not the only cost in contingency planning?                                                 | Besides downtime, recovery efforts also incur costs, such as maintaining redundant systems for quick recovery. Organizations must balance the costs of disruption against the costs of recovery, factoring in the necessary redundancies for effective contingency management.                                                                                               |
| What is the significance of cost balancing in contingency planning?                                        | Cost balancing in contingency planning is essential to optimize the length of disruption time against the costs incurred for recovery. Organizations must manage both disruption costs and recovery costs to maintain operational effectiveness while ensuring financial feasibility.                                                                                              |

| What is the primary objective of contingency planning?                                                                                                          | The primary objective is to bring the system back to normalcy in the minimum time possible, as determined by management based on the costs involved.                         |
| Why is management involvement crucial in contingency planning?                                                                                                   | Contingency planning cannot be effectively conducted without management's willingness to invest in redundancies and prioritize restoration of systems.                      |
| How does the impact of an incident determine the action taken?                                                                                                 | The action triggered depends on the impact level: an IRP is activated for low impact, switching to DRP for moderate impact, and BCP for significant disruption.           |
| Who typically leads the initiative in contingency planning?                                                                                                     | The initiative is typically led by the CEO or CIO, depending on the severity of the incident and the necessary actions to restore operations.                               |
| What should be documented after an incident occurs?                                                                                                            | There should be structured documentation covering what happened during the incident, including a report of the protocol followed and the results of the incident response. |
| What are the three phases of an Incident Response Plan (IRP)?                                                                                                   | The three phases are before the incident, during the incident, and after the incident.                                                                                      |

| What are the categories of indicators for incidents according to Pipkin?                                                                                        | The categories are possible indicators, probable indicators, and definite indicators, which require expertise to interpret correctly.                                        |
| What are the different strategies for Business Continuity Planning (BCP)?                                                                                      | Strategies include hot sites (immediately ready), warm sites (ready within a defined time), and cold sites (can be operational in a longer time frame).                    |
| What role does testing play in contingency planning?                                                                                                           | Testing ensures that the organization is prepared for potential incidents, involving periodic checks and simulated attacks to assess readiness.                              |
| What are red teams, blue teams, and purple teams in the context of cybersecurity drills?                                                                        | Red teams simulate attacks, blue teams defend against those attacks, and purple teams moderate the process to improve both offense and defense strategies.                   |
