| Why should one question emails from familiar sources? | Familiar emails can still be fraudulent; attackers may mimic trusted senders in "phishing" attempts to steal information. |
| What is a phishing email? | A deceptive email that tricks recipients into providing personal information or clicking on malicious links, often appearing from a trusted source. |
| How did the suspicious email differ from a real professional email? | The tone was unusually personal, with phrases not typical for formal emails, and the sender's email address was not from an official domain. |
