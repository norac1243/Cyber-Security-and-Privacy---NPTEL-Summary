| What is the main focus of GRC in the context of cybersecurity?                                          | GRC focuses on managing cyber assets effectively as part of a broader management framework rather than solely on cybersecurity technology.                                |
| How is cyber security perceived within the GRC framework?                                               | Cyber security is viewed as one of many risk management initiatives that organizations need to address within an overall enterprise risk management (ERM) framework.       |
| What are the three approaches to cyber security management?                                              | 1. GRC approach 2. Standards-driven approach 3. Textbook approach.                                                                                                       |
| Describe the GRC approach to cyber security management.                                                  | The GRC approach integrates cyber security into the overall risk management framework, considering it alongside other risks like operational and market risks.                |
| What does the standards-driven approach entail?                                                           | This approach treats cyber security as a separate issue, focusing on implementing specific cybersecurity standards defined by bodies like ISO and NIST.                      |
| How does the textbook approach differ from the other two approaches?                                     | The textbook approach emphasizes education and training on concepts related to cyber security management, aligning practices with established frameworks without strict compliance. |
| What is the significance of risk management in cybersecurity?                                            | Cyber threats pose risks that must be managed, highlighting the importance of understanding risk management in the context of cyber assets.                                 |
| Why is it important for organizations to be prepared for cyber threats?                                  | Organizations need to be prepared for unpredictable future events and potential cyber incidents, emphasizing the need for proactive risk management strategies.               |
| What is an example of a significant data breach mentioned in the text?                                   | The Marriott data breach in December 2019, where 500 million data records were compromised, is cited as an example of the growing volume and impact of cyber incidents.      |
| What is the relationship between physical security and cyber security?                                    | Just as physical security protects tangible assets, cyber security is essential for safeguarding digital assets against unauthorized access and threats.                     |
| How can organizations prioritize cyber security?                                                          | Cyber security should be prioritized in the strategic planning of an organization to ensure it is addressed at a higher management level.                                     |
| Why is cyber security considered at both operational and strategic levels?                                                                                              | Cyber security should be considered at both levels to address cyber risk comprehensively. Strategic planning and contingency planning are part of the organizational approach to managing these risks.                                                                                      |
