This could include acknowledging a temporary, unusual incident and emphasizing their commitment to customer privacy and resolving the issue as soon as possible. Taking ownership of the situation helps build trust with customers rather than hiding information that could lead to greater damage if revealed later.                                                                                                                                             |

Additionally, it may affect personal commitments with the current Qdata owner. Despite these challenges, the long-term benefits of enhanced security may outweigh the drawbacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Using careful language, they can assure customers that they are taking the situation seriously. Learning from other corporations, they may initially release statements about irregularities and then follow up with more detailed reports as forensic investigations are completed.                                                                                                                                          |

However, if the company emphasizes professionalism and accountability, employees may believe their roles are secure. The culture of responsibility among senior management will affect how employees perceive their job security and the company's commitment to resolving the crisis. Each manager’s accountability also plays a role in maintaining morale and trust within the team.                                                                                               |
