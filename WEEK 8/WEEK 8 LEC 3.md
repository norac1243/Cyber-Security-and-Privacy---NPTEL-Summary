| What does transferring data management to cloud computing entail?                                                    | Transferring data management to cloud computing involves moving responsibilities to a third-party vendor, which includes aspects like defense, mitigation, acceptance, and termination, forming a comprehensive risk management approach.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| What is the difference between transferring and owning assets in cloud computing?                                     | A company can either transfer risk to a vendor or choose to retain ownership of assets while outsourcing services. The responsibility for mitigation lies with the client if they choose to own their assets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| What are managed services in IT?                                                                                      | Managed services refer to outsourcing IT services to third parties, such as Wipro or TCS, where the client retains ownership of assets but the service provider manages the IT services, including cybersecurity management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| How does mitigation differ from defense in risk management?                                                           | Mitigation focuses on minimizing the impact of an incident after it has occurred, while defense involves proactive measures to prevent attacks. Mitigation is about contingency planning and impact reduction, not just building defenses like firewalls.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| What does the term acceptance mean in the context of risk management?                                               | Acceptance refers to a decision to acknowledge potential risks without taking proactive measures, often based on economic justification. Organizations may choose acceptance when the cost of mitigation or defense exceeds the potential loss from a cybersecurity incident.                                                                                                                                                                     |

If maintaining a business unit becomes economically unviable, an organization may choose to terminate that unit.                                                                                                                                                       |
| What is the significance of economic justification in cybersecurity risk management decisions?                       | Economic justification is essential for assessing the costs and benefits of cybersecurity investments. Organizations must analyze whether the benefits outweigh the costs and ensure their decisions are supported by cost-benefit analyses to determine the viability of risk management strategies.                                                                                                                                         |
| What is Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE), and how is it calculated?                                                 | Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) is the estimated yearly loss magnitude based on the asset's value and exposure factor. It is calculated by multiplying the Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) by the frequency of occurrences per year, giving an estimate of total potential losses for a given asset over a year.                                                                                                                                 |
| How do you determine whether to invest in cybersecurity controls based on ALE?                                       | To justify investing in cybersecurity controls, the post-investment ALE (ALE post) plus the annualized cost of safeguards (ACS) must be less than the prior ALE (ALE prior). If this condition is met, the investment is considered a positive cash flow and economically justified; if not, it may not be worth the investment.                                                                                                        |
| Why is continuous monitoring important in risk management?                                                            | Continuous monitoring is crucial to ensure that the risk control strategies implemented are delivering the expected gains. As actual outcomes may differ from initial estimates, management needs to verify that investments in cybersecurity are effectively reducing losses and providing the intended benefits over time.                                                                                                                    |

| What is the economic justification for cybersecurity controls?               | It involves a cost-benefit analysis where benefits should outweigh costs.                                       |
| What is the basic principle in justifying cybersecurity risk management?     | Gains should outweigh costs.                                                                                    |

| What is Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)?                                       | The loss magnitude calculated as asset value multiplied by exposure factor.                                     |
| How do you calculate overall gain or loss in cost-benefit analysis?         | Overall gain or loss is calculated as ALE post-investment plus annualized cost of safeguards (ACS).             |
| What does ACS stand for?                                                    | Annualized Cost of Safeguards.                                                                                 |
| What should be true for ALE post plus ACS in order for an investment to be justified? | It should be less than ALE prior.                                                                               |
| What happens if the ACS is very high?                                       | It may not justify the control at all, as the gain would decrease.                                             |
| Why is continuous monitoring important after implementing risk controls?     | To ensure that the investment is delivering the expected gains, as actual results may differ from estimates.     |
