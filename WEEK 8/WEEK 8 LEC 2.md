| Question | Answer |
| -------- | ------ |
| How does the biometric system process a ration payment? | The user shows their fingerprint to authenticate, enabling the payment directly from their bank account. |
| What challenge did the biometric system face with fingerprints? | The ridges in the finger wear out for manual laborers, making fingerprint recognition difficult. |
| How did they overcome the fingerprint challenge? | They used a combination of all five fingerprints to improve identification accuracy. |
| What is the trade-off in biometric authentication? | There’s a trade-off between false positives (incorrect access) and false negatives (denying legitimate access). |
| How can adjusting a CAT score affect student admissions? | A strict cutoff (99.99) reduces false positives but may exclude good students, while a relaxed score (80%) lowers false negatives but raises false positives. |
| What is FAR and FRR in biometrics? | FAR is the false acceptance rate, and FRR is the false rejection rate. They have an inverse relationship. |
| What is the optimal point in biometrics authentication? | The optimal point is the Crossover Error Rate (CER), where FAR and FRR are balanced. |
| Name some commonly used biometric methods. | Fingerprints, retina, blood vessel patterns, and iris recognition. |
| What is a firewall’s purpose? | A firewall prevents unauthorized access to data by setting rules on who can access the system. |
| How does a firewall restrict access? | It blocks access from specific IP addresses or networks, preventing unauthorized connections. |
| What is a DMZ in network security? | A Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) is a section of the network that acts as a buffer between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks. |
| What is the purpose of a DMZ? | It protects the trusted network by providing controlled access to resources without directly exposing them. |
| How does a proxy server work? | A proxy server acts as an intermediary, insulating the trusted network from external threats. |
| What does cryptography prevent in cybersecurity? | It prevents unauthorized users from reading data even if they gain access during transmission. |
| What does encryption mean? | Encryption is the process of converting a message into an unreadable format to secure its contents. |
| What does end-to-end encryption ensure in messaging? | It ensures that only the sender and receiver can read the messages, with no access in between. |
| What is the function of a cipher in encryption? | A cipher transforms plaintext into an encrypted, unintelligible message (ciphertext). |
| What is the process of converting ciphertext back to plaintext? | Decryption or deciphering, often using a key. |
| How is a key used in encryption? | A key is used to encrypt a message, making it secure, and the same or a different key decrypts it for the intended recipient. |
| What are the two types of encryption? | Symmetric key encryption and asymmetric key encryption. |
| Describe symmetric key encryption. | The same key is used for both encryption and decryption. |
| Describe asymmetric key encryption. | Different keys are used for encryption (public key) and decryption (private key). |

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Why is key management a challenge in symmetric encryption? | In symmetric encryption, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption, so if you send the key over an unsecure network, it can be intercepted, making the encryption vulnerable. |
| How does asymmetric key encryption solve the issue of key management? | Asymmetric encryption uses two keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The public key can be shared openly, while the private key remains secure, allowing secure communication even over unsecure networks. |
| What key does Bob use to send a message to Alice in asymmetric encryption? | Bob uses Alice’s public key to encrypt the message, and only Alice can decrypt it using her private key. |
| Why is the public key in asymmetric encryption considered secure? | The public key can only be used for encryption, not decryption, so even if it's intercepted, the message remains unreadable without the private key. |
| What is a digital signature? | A digital signature is a form of encryption where the sender signs a message with their private key, and the recipient uses the sender’s public key to verify the message, ensuring authenticity and non-repudiation. |
| Why are digital signatures important in business transactions? | Digital signatures provide non-repudiation, ensuring that the sender cannot deny sending a signed message or document, which is crucial for trust in transactions. |
| What is an example of a system that uses non-repudiation in e-governance? | The Indian government’s e-filing system for mandatory company reports uses digital signatures to ensure that submitted documents cannot be denied or repudiated later. |
| What role does a digital certificate play in web security? | A digital certificate verifies that a website is genuine and authentic, helping browsers confirm they are accessing the correct website, not a fraudulent one. |
| What are the three broad techniques of encryption? | The three main techniques are substitution, transposition, and XOR (Exclusive OR). |
| What is substitution in encryption? | In substitution, each character in the plaintext is replaced with another character based on a rule or key. An example is Caesar's cipher, which shifts characters by a fixed number. |
| What is transposition in encryption? | In transposition, the positions of characters in the plaintext are rearranged according to a specific rule or key. |
| What is XOR in encryption? | XOR encryption uses the Exclusive OR logic operation, where bits in the plaintext are combined with bits in a key to produce ciphertext, providing a secure bitwise transformation. |
| How does Caesar's cipher work? | Caesar's cipher shifts each character in the plaintext by a certain number of positions in the alphabet, based on a fixed key. |
| What is monoalphabetic substitution? | Monoalphabetic substitution replaces each character in the plaintext with a corresponding character in the cipher alphabet, using a single rule for all characters. |
| What is polyalphabetic substitution? | Polyalphabetic substitution uses multiple substitution rules or keys, with each character potentially following a different substitution rule. |
| What does the mod 26 operation do in Caesar's cipher? | Mod 26 ensures the alphabetical substitution wraps around to the beginning of the alphabet if it surpasses 'Z'. |
| How is a polyalphabetic substitution applied to encrypt the word "DOMS" with the key "IITM"? | Each letter in "DOMS" is shifted based on corresponding letters in the key "IITM", creating a unique substitution for each character. |
| What is the truth table for Exclusive OR? | For Exclusive OR (XOR): If both inputs are the same, the output is 0; if the inputs differ, the output is 1. |
| How does XOR work in encryption? | Each bit in the plaintext is XORed with a corresponding bit in the key, producing a ciphertext that is difficult to reverse without the original key. |
