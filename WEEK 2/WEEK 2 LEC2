| What is the first step in ensuring confidentiality in cybersecurity?       | Identification - establishing a credible identity for individuals accessing resources.                                                                     |
| Give an example of identification in daily life.                           | Showing an Aadhaar card or student ID to prove identity and access rights at a security gate.                                                              |
| Why is identification important in cybersecurity?                          | Identification confirms who is who, determining access rights and enabling confidentiality.                                                                |
| What is the difference between identification and authentication?          | Identification establishes who someone is, while authentication verifies they are who they claim to be.                                                    |
| What follows identification in the confidentiality process?                | Authentication - verifying the established identity through credentials, like ID cards or biometrics.                                                      |
| What role does authentication play after identification?                   | Authentication ensures a person is truly the claimed identity, granting access based on valid credentials.                                                 |
| What is an example of authentication in online services?                   | Logging into an email account with a username (claim) and a password (verification).                                                                       |
| Why can't you use any ID card for certain services like telecom?           | Services like telecom require government-issued IDs (e.g., Aadhaar) to confirm citizenship and legal identification for access.                            |
| What does confidentiality protect in cybersecurity?                        | Confidentiality protects sensitive information by limiting access only to verified, authorized individuals.                                                |
| How does biometric data relate to authentication?                          | Biometric data (e.g., fingerprints or retina scans) confirms identity by matching personal physical traits with stored data, ensuring accurate verification. |
| What is a password in the context of authentication?                                              | A password is a long-standing method of authentication where a user discloses something only they know to verify their identity. The system cross-checks the entered password with its records, granting access if correct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| How is biometric authentication different from password authentication?                            | Biometric authentication is based on something you have (e.g., fingerprints or facial recognition), while password authentication is based on something you know (e.g., a password).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Why is multi-factor authentication used?                                                          | Multi-factor authentication enhances security by requiring more than one method of verification, making it harder for unauthorized individuals to gain access even if a password is compromised.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| What are the three key concepts of cybersecurity related to access control?                       | The three key concepts are identification, authentication, and authorization.
