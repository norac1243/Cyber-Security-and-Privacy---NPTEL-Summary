| What management lesson can be learned from the Titanic and Target cases?                           | Leaders should not ignore safety warnings; vigilance is essential in management to avoid preventable disasters.                                                                                                                                |
| According to Andrew Grove, what attitude is crucial for managers?                                  | A paranoid mindset – worrying about every possible issue to avoid complacency – is essential, especially in competitive environments like cyber security.                                                                                       |
| How did the Target breach highlight the role of management in cyber security?                      | Despite huge investments in cyber security, managerial failures, such as allowing vulnerabilities and ignoring risks, led to the breach, showing that management oversight is crucial.                                                          |
| Why was the Target breach considered a "watershed moment" for cyber security regulation?           | It emphasized the need for clearer, comprehensive regulations on reporting and managing data breaches in the U.S., which lacked a unified cyber security law.                                                                                  |
| Why might a company choose to invest minimally in cyber security?                                  | Some companies may decide that paying fines and facing court cases is cheaper than investing heavily in security, especially in the absence of strict regulations.                                                                              |
| What is the downside for a company not investing in cyber security in a competitive industry?      | Lack of investment in security can harm a company's reputation, as customers are more likely to trust companies with strong security measures.                                                                                                 |
| How might competition influence a company's cyber security investments?                            | In a competitive market, companies are likely to invest more in cyber security to maintain customer trust, as others doing so will set a standard that all need to follow.                                                                     |
