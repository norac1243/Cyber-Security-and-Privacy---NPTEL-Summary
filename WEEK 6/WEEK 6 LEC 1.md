| What is the first step in quantitatively assessing cyber risk?                                                                         | The first step is risk identification, which involves knowing your assets, similar to knowing yourself in war strategy. An organization must identify its assets and assign identifiers or tags to them.                                                                                                                                                              |

Each asset can be scored on a scale to determine its importance to the organization.                                                                                                                                  |
| What is a weighted score in the context of asset value assessment?                                                                       | A weighted score is a scoring system that assigns different weights to various criteria when evaluating an asset's value. This helps prioritize assets based on their overall importance and impact on the organization.                                                                                                                                                   |
| Can you provide an example of how an organization might assess an asset's value?                                                      | For instance, an organization might assess an EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) document set by evaluating its impact on revenue, profitability, and public image, ultimately assigning it a score between 1 and 100 based on these criteria.                                                                                                                                   |
| What example demonstrates the highest value of an asset based on the discussed criteria?                                               | An example is the "customer order via SSL," which received the highest value score of 100, as its failure would halt business operations, demonstrating its critical importance.                                                                                                                                                                                |
